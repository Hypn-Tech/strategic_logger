Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Strategic Logger, add it to your project as a dependency:

dependencies:strategic\_logger: ^1.0.0

### Initialization

Initialize the logger once during the startup of your application:

```dart
import 'package:strategic\_logger/strategic\_logger.dart';

void main() {
    logger.initialize(
        level: LogLevel.info,
        strategies: [
            ConsoleLogStrategy(),
            FirebaseAnalyticsLogStrategy(),
            FirebaseCrashlyticsLogStrategy(),
        ],
    );
}
```
### Usage

Logging messages is straightforward:

```dart
logger.log('This is an info log');
logger.error('This is an error message');
logger.fatal('This is a fatal error');
```

You can also log detailed events:

```dart

logger.log('User logged in', event: LogEvent(eventName: 'user\_login'));

```

Extending the Logger
--------------------

To add a custom log strategy, extend the LogStrategy class:

```dart

class MyCustomLogStrategy extends LogStrategy {
    @override
    Future log({dynamic message, LogEvent? event}) async {
    // Implement custom logging logic here
    }
}
```

Register your custom strategy during logger initialization.
